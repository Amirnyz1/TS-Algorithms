# ðŸ§® Two Sum â€“ Brute Force Approach

This repository contains a basic implementation of the **Two Sum** problem using a brute-force approach written in **TypeScript**.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return the **indices of the two numbers** such that they add up to `target`.

You may assume:
- There is exactly one solution.
- You may not use the same element twice.

---

## ðŸ“š Example

```ts
Input: nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 26  
Output: [2, 3] // Because nums[2] + nums[3] == 11 + 15 == 26





# âš¡ Two Sum â€“ Optimized Hash Map Approach

This repository contains an optimized solution to the classic **Two Sum** problem using a **hash map** in **TypeScript**.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return the **indices of the two numbers** such that they add up to `target`.

You may assume:
- There is exactly one solution.
- You may not use the same element twice.

---

## ðŸ“š Example

```ts
Input: nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9  
Output: [0, 1] // Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9
